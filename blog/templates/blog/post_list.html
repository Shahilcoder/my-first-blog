Data (/ˈdeɪtə/ DAY-tə, /ˈdætə/ DA-tə, or /ˈdɑːtə/ DAH-tə)[1] is a set of values of qualitative or<br> quantitative variables. Pieces of data are individual pieces of information. While the concept of data is<br> commonly associated with scientific research, data is collected by a huge range of organizations and institutions, including businesses (e.g., sales data, revenue, profits,<br></p>

Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it can be visualized using graphs,<br> images or other analysis tools. Data as a general concept refers to the fact that some existing <br>information or knowledge is represented or coded in some form suitable for better usage or processing. Raw<br> data ("unprocessed data") is a collection of numbers or characters before it has been "cleaned" and <br>corrected by researchers.<br></p>

Raw data needs to be corrected to remove outliers or obvious instrument or data entry errors (e.g., a <br>thermometer reading from an outdoor Arctic location recording a tropical temperature). Data processing <br>commonly occurs by stages, and the "processed data" from one stage may be considered the "raw data" of the<br> next stage. Field data is raw data that is collected in an uncontrolled "in situ" environment. <br>Experimental data is<br></p>

Data, information, knowledge and wisdom are closely related concepts, but each has its own role in <br>relation to the other, and each term has its own meaning. According to a common view, data is collected <br>and analyzed; data only becomes information suitable for making decisions once it has been analyzed in <br>some fashion. [6] Knowledge is derived from extensive amounts of experience dealing with information on a <br>subject. For example, the height of Mount Everest is generally considered data. The height can be recorded<br> precisely with an altimeter and entered into a database. This data may be included in a book along with<br> other data on Mount Everest to describe the mountain in a manner useful for those who<br></p>
